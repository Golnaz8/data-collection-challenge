# data-collection-challenge


## Overview 
In this project, I applied web-scraping techniques to gather and analyze data about Mars from online sources. Using tools like BeautifulSoup and Splinter, I scraped news articles and weather data from Mars-focused websites. The project demonstrates skills in web automation, HTML parsing, data manipulation, and data visualization. The ultimate goal was to collect, organize, and analyze the data to extract meaningful insights and present them effectively.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The core language used for scripting the analysis, providing robust support for data manipulation and file handling.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle, clean, and analyze the school and student data effectively.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library used for web scraping, enabling efficient extraction and parsing of data from HTML and XML documents.
- **Splinter**: A testing library for browser automation, used to interact with web pages and navigate through the dataset efficiently during scraping.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library used for generating plots, charts, and visual representations of the data, enhancing the readability of the analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive computing environment that facilitates data exploration, visualization, and narrative analysis, making it easy to document and present findings.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.

## Objective
By completing this project, I strengthened my core data analysis skills, including:

- Collecting data via web scraping.
- Organizing and storing scraped data.
- Analyzing data to uncover trends and patterns.
- Communicating insights effectively using data visualizations.


This project demonstrates practical applications of web scraping and data analysis in real-world scenarios, preparing me for more advanced challenges in data science and automation.
